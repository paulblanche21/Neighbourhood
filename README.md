# Neighbourhood
Getting to know your community

hey everyone. 
Only a little bit of programming experience and this project is too big for a beginner so I need some help. 
I had an idea. 
Have you ever been at the bus stop/walking the dog and kept seeing this beautiful woman/man. You know they live close by and you would love to get to know them. You are not friends so facebook is out. You are neighbours however. 
What about if your are new to the neighbourhood and want to get to know the neighbours?  This was difficult for me as I an quite shy but after a year here I was lucky enough to be invited to a local event and I finally know some of my neighbours. This could be so much easier. 
If there is an event you want to promote within your community like a local get together, meetings etc. There is no social network for our community. 
I would like to set up a social network that is based on your location say within a mile radius. So once you sign up you will be automatically be connected to the people that live around you. They will have a profile, wall, status screen, community blog, events , chat , and whatever we want really. 

With the hustle and bustle of everyday live we need to connect with our community again and who knows, that one special person could be living 4 doors  down. 
Tell me what you think.
